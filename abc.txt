He was clearly signaling for a substitution. Pellistri misread it and high 5 him.
"I'll never forget Bruno standing behind Ole while the crowd booed him, gesturing that the players should share the blame and that it was on all of them, not just Ole. 

How can anyone believe that this man was demanding to be subbed off when we were down? He's never been one to hide behind anybody."
That is such a Wout goal (even though he hasn’t scored a lot yet)
"I hope Pellistri gets more game time. I think Antony could do with the competition to improve his consistency. Plus, he can't play every game."
"I love Bruno. 

Genuinely can’t believe the vitriol and hatred that gets from people. Like I’ll say “I hate Agüero” but, obviously I don’t actually hate him. He’s just a guy that scored goals for a rival team. It’s all fun and games.

But, the way people talk about Bruno you’d swear he committed war crimes. Talking about his family, his character as a human being. It’s just crossing the line. 

There are potential rapists that get less hate than Bruno."
Pellistri should've earned a start in the 2nd leg.
Gary told me that hug was secret code meaning he loves the Annfield sign. The mirror is reporting.
MY CAPTAIN!
We can talk about Bruno now?
"Great angle of the goal - you can see it’s a worked on routine with big Weg bully his marker out the way leaving Pellistri clear. Also having conditioned the left back on going inside with Antony was a very well worked goal. VISIONS

ps. Bruno played out his skin and is always my cap’n. but haters gon hate."
I think the lack of consistency is the main complaint that I have seen
"If people want to maintain that Casemiro's card was a red, that's fine, I'm sure we can accept that even begrudgingly. The issue is the clear inconsistency by referees from game to game."
The KWP two footed tackle through AG was worse. Taylor and Marriner need to face repercussions for this. Twice this season we’ve had players face potential serious injuries and there wasn’t even a yellow given.
"The most ridiculous part;

One scenario there is a legitimate attempt at the ball and perhaps some intentional afters; we'll never legitimately know . . . .

The other scenario is well after the ball is gone; not even a remote possibility that this was a challenge for a ball - nothing but blatant intentional contact.  Again, we may never know if the player intended to injure an opponent, but under these circumstances, there's basically no doubt that there was intent to foul and in doing so the opponent was needlessly endangered."
"Well, this is the second time Casemiro gets a controversial red card, it's not ok."
"There appeared to be an agenda! Otherwise how does that motherfucking Southampton defender, crawling on all fours, stopping the ball with his arm not constitute a penalty? Wasn't even VAR reviewed!?"
"I usually stay away from ref analysis stuff like this as I usually associate that with being a delusional Arsenal fan but on this occasion I can't help but feel that something fishy is going on.

Casemiro red was harsh but I understand the concept that the tackle was uncontrolled and endangered the other player. However the walker peters tackle was also uncontrolled and did literally injure the other player and yet wasn't even a foul? Both instances the defender got the ball but was maybe a little reckless.

The handball was probably as much as a stonewall pen as you can get. The ball travels a good 20 yards and nobody can say the hand was in a natural position unless you always run about with your hands on the ground.

IMO 1 bad reffing decision with terrible inconsistency followed by a reffing decision which is borderline corruption."
"One was redirected by the ball, the other was not."
"I do think Case was a red, if it was other way around lets be honest we’d be screaming for a red

But the consistency is horrendous. That’s either a red all the time or it isn’t. 

Also that handball pen  how is that not a pen ffs."
Casemiros is a red card *if* the refs were consistent this season but it’s not a red card now considering the amount of times tackles like this happen every week with no card given or no VAR intervention for every other team.
Man I love Casemiro so much
"The last time he score in a cup, we won that cup ;)"
"I think it was a huge relief for him- that celebration was the ""fucking finally"" moment. Maybe it means he'll play a bit more relaxed now, he was definitely a bit on edge and under pressure. Huge goal for him mentally, but also for the team to gain a bit more separation for the second leg."
Happy for Wout'w goal but Pellistri was so good though
Reminds me of Dan James 1st goal celebration
Beautiful. It looks like he has exhausted all his pent-up emotions at the end of that knee slide.
I’ve watched this so many times and my goodness the goosebumps I get from his roar post-knee slide 
"Tears in my eyes and his eyes.

Hope he can get another few trophies by the end of the season."
How can you not love a player for who it means so much to score for that badge? He may not be the most talented striker but he gives his all every game.
"Love it. Looks on the verge of tears he's so happy lol. Can tell that meant a lot and he's been so close to scoring in the last few games.

Honestly really want us to sign him in the summer. He's not going to play as much if we get a striker in the summer but he can certainly pitch in next season as 3rd or 4th striker. We need more players like him just with extra quality (without being horrible)"
Fuck Andy Carrol
"We really need the bodies in the closing weeks. 
- martial 
- erikson 
- garnacho 

3 big positions that will add a bit of depth"
It's no coincidence that our form has dipped without him. Casemiro's influence is obviously evident. But Eriksen is super important in the scheme of things. He has been greatly missed.
"Just in time for a strong finish on all fronts!

Hopefully ETH unleashes a FIT Martial as well and the guy REMAINS FIT ffs!"
Can’t come back soon enough
BRU-RIKSEN is coming back on the menu boys.
scary hours. league isn’t ready
"Bruno Eriksen Case midfield with Fred and Sabitzer on the bench

Rashford Martial Antony with Sancho, Garnacho, Weghorst, Pellistri on the bench 

Scary hour otw"
"So happy he finally learned to tie his shoes (/s)

Can't wait to have him back!!"
We need his composure so bad
Loving the Fergie time pose!
He looks great
"The greatest there ever was, the greatest there ever will be."
handsome fella
"He looks fitter now than he did in the 90s 

Wonder if Caths got him on the quinoa and spinach smoothies

Yes boss

"
The smile 
Still looking as great as ever.
I’d be embarrassed to have him on my team
Him asking for the ball and Virgil absolutely fucking kicking it out of the stadium 
I wondered why he wasn’t closing down any of our players during the games…turns out he was man marking the referee.
I think even a lot of United fans are sick of his antics. Not captain material
"Lots of posts get created about time wasting but I think play acting is a bigger problem. 

I think if players tell the ref how to do his job and tell him who he should be booking they should also receive a card their job is  to play so just play. This also includes surrounding the referee as only the captain's are allowed to approach the ref so give cards to others that do it so it stops. 

Also players that dive, over exaggerate challenges and fake injuries to time waste should be booked too. This includes players who get their shirts touched and roll around like they've been shot. Players who get touched on the chest and fall like a house of cards holding their head like they've been assaulted. Players like Grealish who falls so much he's either playing in slippers or he's tripping over his own shadow. 

Also there needs to be changes about possible head injures as many teams are abusing the system. If a player goes down holding his head because the opposite team is on the counter attack and he knows that the ref has to stop play because of head injuries. If VAR realises this is acting to manipulate the referees they should receive yellow cards too as it's embarrassing to watch and gives the sport a bad name.

Fernandes does all of the above

Another point from this game was that Salah received a yellow card for removing his shirt yet Fernandes went unpunished for pushing the referees asst so explain that one................."
"That's their fucking *captain*. I'd be embarassed beyond belief.

Imagine watching your captain not only be the worst of worst playactors - But to actually just let somene run past him and give up. Absolutely pathetic player."
"If ever there was a team that deserved to get destroyed it was them. 

Between Bruno, Antony and the 4ft0 center back, fuck them all."
"Wow, I think that half arsed tackle on Bajcetic followed by a slow walk at the end said it all."
"He’s such a rat, can’t stand the man"
"I laughed when I saw that live, especially when Salah looked up and assured everyone that everything was fine, nothing to see here."
"How innocent ""luke shaw has just run into him"" how threatning ""he has just snapped has Nunez"" cant even comment for one instance without his bias."
"Salah and Nunez are such interesting duo, they probably dont understand each other because of language barrier but they seem very supportive for each other"
Pathetic from Shaw.
They knew they couldn’t win so resorted to trying to get one of ours sent off. Absolute scum team.
Saves Shaw’s life and shows a certain rat how a captain should behave. King 
Thank god Salah was there lol
He responded even better with two goals)
Should’ve celebrated in his face when he scored.
There’s gotta be footage somewhere of Shaw’s face after Nunez’ second goal
Golden time period.
I really missed dancing to Sturridge's celebration when he scored
This was one of the most outrageous seasons of all time Suarez and sturridge literally almost out scores one of the leagues worst defenses to win a title
Will never forget Sunderland away when Suarez came back from his ban. Their partnership was on another level
Might be crazy to say given we've won literally every trophy under Klopp but 2013-14 is the most fun season I've ever had as a Liverpool fan tbh. Everyone was so unexpected and unpredictable and the games were never boring.
"Favourite memory of this partnership was the 6-3 against Cardiff - that season in a nutshell.

Concede three to an incredibly medicore Cardiff side? Doesn't matter, we'll just casually score six.

Suarez was his usual electric self but Sturridge scored a hugely underrated goal at the back post."
I came to Liverpool in a study abroad program in January of 2014 and it was incredible experiencing the city as this title race unfolded. Watching the Merseyside Derby at Bierkeller was one of my favorite memories.
SAS!
Sturridge…that man burnt so brightly 
"Never seen a player carry a team harder than suarez did, iv seen van persie carry arsenal and Bale carry spurs. Suarez is the best player i have ever seen in a Liverpool shirt....."
Hahaha what a shithouser he is. Love it.
Carra is a massive wind up merchant lmao
Hahahahaha class
Fucking elite level trolling
That's my pundit!
Sponsorship opportunity
I love this man hahahaha
Neville in fucking shambles
Just doing our part to get Everton relegated
I remember this meme from when we won against rampaging City and lost against Swansea I think?
2015/16 memes are back
Sherwood Forest FC
So true. This picture describes perfectly this season.
Liverhood Forest Club
The comforting nostalgia of glasses Klopp - true excellence
"Ha, ha! Great point and very nice imagery!"
White kit curse continues......
Seems like a nice guy and I wish him success elsewhere. But if I'm honest I've never felt this good about sacking before.
BAH GAWD THATS NAGELSMANN’S MUSIC
Boehly already a proper Chelsea owner sacking a manager hahahaha
"I’m grown up to admit I was wrong about him. Nagelsmann has to be the clear top choice, right?"
"Utterly disastrous appointment, will go down as the worst manager we've had in the last 20+ years."
holy shit I thought it would never come
Ucl here we fucking come
"Potter did his best out there, that's how it goes right."
His original fall in confidence was rumored to be coincident with a bad break up. Maybe his new girl is just a giant ego boost ;)
He looks mentally locked in when he plays and it’s such a big difference than where he was seasons ago. I back him to be our #1 in seasons ahead and letting slonina be our back up
The OG 7 year contract
My Kepa
"He's been amazing this season. It's a shame the ghost of that poor season still haunts him because almost every time he concedes he still gets the ""typical Kepa!"" treatment despite him making save after save prior."
Thiago Silva has been injured for like a week and you’ve all forgotten about him already?
"Kepa is our POTS for me. Apart from the City game, he’s saved us on so many occasions, his kicking has been supreme and he allows us to play out from the back so easily with his calmness."
He’s got that armband when Kova goes off for a reason.
Silva is player of the season imo. Kepa wouldn't have anywhere near as many cleansheets without Silva commanding the back line like he does. Kepa has been very good but he still has the potential for a brain stutter in big games like vs Spurs and he still isn't good at commanding the area. Silvas compensated alot for Kepas weaker aspects.
"This is the same guy who said 'I want to build a team no one wants to play against' when he first came in. Nobody should be questioning his elite mentality. It's what makes him a world class manager/coach. It was Tuchel that gave us 3 wins in a row vs City in 2021 and caused Pep to overload his brain and make mistakes. You're talking about a man with class. 

Mentioning potter in the same breath is an actual insult to tuchel."
Mid table manager vs world class manager
Every day I wonder what we did to deserve to be in this mess
How long do we recon Potter has left? Must be on the thinnest of strings.
"Forget Pique, we’re the ones who traded a ferrari for a twingo. Stupid Boehly/Eghbali destroying the legacy of a club that doesn’t accept mediocrity."
![gif](giphy|d2lcHJTG5Tscg)
The difference between the 2 is immeasurable. Sad
TT looks Imperial
He looks so much better in blue. He looks like a villain in Bayern Colors
"Fuck Bohely, Fuck Russia and Fuck the UK government"
How this man has come to Chelsea in the twilight of his career and become a Chelsea legend is incredible. Truly one of the best to wear Chelsea blue of all time.
"That tackle looked so bad, I thought Reece was dead there..."
Future manager right there
"Once he hangs up his boots, he should be our Defensive coach. Fofana, Chalobah, Badia, Colwill 
All these young CBs will learn so much from him"
The single best thing Frank Lampard did for this football club as manager was integrating Reece James and signing Thiago Silva.
Build him a statue
I love Thiago so fkn much. And to think I doubted him when he first joined. What a fucking dumbass bitch I was
HES ONE OF US!!!
"Fucking proper Chels, you know he’s seething being on the sidelines and wants to get stuck in.

![gif](giphy|TxBoVHzPJmntndjdD1)"
Do we know if Reece is alright? Looked nasty
"Who is this person, and what has he done with Graham Potter "
We have unlocked Dark Potter
We can lose 7-0 to Everton if it means a CL
Beginning to think Boehly killed Potter and brought in a doppelganger to replace him
BOOTY SHAKIN!
Im probably overreacting here but YES GRAHAM!!
So that’s all the fans needed. He just had to start using the f word
Just me or looks like Roman from this angle?
I like this graham potter.
"Love this. 

Although he sounds like a 12 year old given permission to say fuck for the first time. "
He looks pleased about it.
The fucking pic hahahaha
"Such a fantastic buy. He was unplayable today.  


No idea who starts from Martinelli, Saka, Trossard and Jesus."
Every Trossard pic has immense meme quality lmfao
"Trossard: I could get 5 assists today, those MFers...."
LEANDRO BOSSARD
Leo gives best facial expressions 
He got that DAWG in him
"Trossard motm but partey a very close second imo, tackles, possession wins, passing, dribbles, all exceptional"
Deserved
Martinelli probably did that against him in training multiple times lol
"""What can you do about it? There's no stopping that.. Pffhhrrttt"""
This is amazing hahaha
"No way. This fucking guy man. I hope he stays here for his whole career and becomes a club legend for us, he’s far too likeable for this not to happen!"
prob seen him do that 1000 times in training
Hahahaha this is amazing. What a goalie
"He is like, ""We don't even need Jesus. We don't even need Jesus."""
"No way, that's insane.

This team is so in sync."
"Marionettes, Aaron is all of them."

If we win the league I'm gonna need this lady to present the trophy and she's gonna have to give it to Benny Blanco.
There she is!
Thank you very much
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
"Fucking finally. 

For a change, a nice calm thank you very much."
honestly at this point this lady is a club icon. if anyone at the club is lurking this subreddit they need to hire her permanently in some capacity
Thank
Somewhat relevant point: White really deserved that assist for that beautiful left footed cross to Martinelli at the back post
Thank you very much!
She was all warmed up by half time. TYVM.
The commentator forget that he shouldn't reveal the script
Holy shit that is an incredible piece of art.
"The virgin Western commentator: I have to remain impartial in my commentary and react to the game as it happens.

Gigachad Arabic commentators: COME ON YOU GUNNERS I HAVE DIVINED THE COALESCING FUTURE TIMELINES AND HAVE FORESEEN YOUR VICTORY, FRET NOT BROTHERS"
This commentator truly believes. Truly
Ha brilliant. The subtle soundtrack made that beautiful.
Those subtitles do a poor job translating and I'm disappointed as an Arabic speaker it missed out on so much poetry and didn't capture all that Issam Chaouali was elegantly foretelling.
Nah this made me cry! This guy believed us from the start.
Arabic is a really poetic language isn't it!
Is this a real translation?
"Arsenal getting the remontada gene. We love to see it.

But on a serious note with this team I genuinely believe they will fight till the last second which is why I don’t get too nervous even when we are trailing."
I'm sorry but unfortunately I'm having saliba detain you for the next two months in London
Get this man tickets till May!
Maybe its time you move to London..
"Clearly you're distracting the opposition players with your charming smile, mate. Good for you. Don't leave the country"
Can we all chip in to get this guy more tickets!
Don't ever miss another game!
"Smile more man you look so unhappy!

Fair play, love the support from across the pond "
What was the process for getting tickets for you? Heading to Europe from Canada next season and want to catch a game.
Canadian here and I am so so jealous!! I hope you had an amazing trip :) I’m hoping to make it out there for next season 
Now youse can't leave.
Bonk!

This is the Spurs content I didn't know I needed.

I've seen Bruno Fernandez throw himself to the ground for much less.
“If we win you’re my brother but if we lose then you’re just my friend”
"Holy fuck they actually did it

Edit: Also, guys, Alasdair is off today lmao"
Odd timing so late at night. Also shocked Stelini is staying for now
I'm surprised Stellini has remained. I thought he'd have gone with Conte.
"On Ali Gold's day off, as is tradition"
Honestly assumed the whole coaching staff would have gone except Mason.
It’s been a pleasure F5ing with you all 
"People trashing Ali Gold in the match thread. Here you fucking go. This is Ali. No touches with no service, but when he does get it, it's done."
"To sign Nagelsman now would cost, Stellini in charge till the summer with a pre agreement for Nagels to come so we don't pay Bayern a bean? Fingers crossed"
"Strange setup that it seems just Conte has left yet all his staff have remained.

Conte must have thought he mentally and physically needed to go."
On Ali Gold’s off day as per usual
I can't believe he's actually said this? Jesus christ
"Well, say what you will but this is more entertaining than whatever he's responsible for on the pitch"
"I often make this Mourinho comparisons, not because I have any love for Mourinho, but just to make a point about Conte's strange public behaviour.

The 3-3 West Ham defeat that was just like this? Mourinho comes out and before any questions says this is a freak result, I don't want to hear any of this history of Tottenham shit, I want to just move on. The boys didn't deserve that.

Whether he believed that or it was true or not - even the king of troll press conferences said that.

Conte just straight up came out and said it's what that lot are used to. Lol.

Maybe this works for Conte and is a masterstroke but I don't see what positive outcome comes from it, but hey"
"Lol Im not against calling out the owners but damn, have some loyalty. This dude is trying to get sacked and cash out."
Unless Levy has a humiliation fetish hes got to be gone tonight lol
"Somewhere in Rome, there’s a Portuguese man having a giggle fit as he digs into his risotto."
How can something be right and wrong at the same time
This is the most Antonio Conte end to this little experiment. Let’s just hope it’s actually the end so we can move onto a manager who doesn’t think he’s bigger than the club.
Directly taking shots at Levy. Would be shocked if he isn’t sacked now
"Guys paid to make the team work, to take players and improve them, to take the sum of its parts and make it better because he is elite

He has done none of that this season, no adaptability, poor results, constant performing below par with no sign of change

It can be the owner, the club, the players but ultimately Conte has not done the job he has been paid for this season, with the same, and argueably some better players we are worst than last season"
calling Human Resources to send that contract over pronto
"I think the main thing is Nagelsmann and Vivell already have a history together. Maybe he would feel more comfortable at Chelsea because of it...

:("
Holy fuck i haven’t laughed so hard haha thanks dude I needed this
Rizz vs Sexual Harassment
Whoever Chelsea hire will be sacked by xmas.
"Levy could have, but wants to wait. Just like how we waited for our perfect appointment - Nuno."
Why does the edit for Levy fit so well lmaoo
Would we really prefer Boehly over Levy?
Nagelsmann will just be another AVB
This is fucking quality
Cannot believe I get to fuckin use this again lmao.
"I, for one, am here for the time line where Levy becomes the most successful manager in history."
"Why shouldn't I have a custom go-kart called Precious1, decorate the track like gollum's cave and make it my domain until the age of man has passed for all time?"
"One does not simply walk into Tottenham. It is a desolate, trophyless land and the very air you breathe is riddled with desperation and unfulfilled longing."
"We do not want any trophies here, thank you! Not today."
He can be manager as long as he fires himself in 18 months
"After 5 games. 
After all....why not? Why can't I sack myself?"
I mean…it could work?
I never noticed before how much Levy looks like Dr.Evil.
"Levy about to go full Glenn Tamplin, never go full Glenn Tamplin"
UCL incoming just for him
"City til we die and forever after.

*2013/14
"City are so fortunate to have been able to effectively replace incredible midfielders.  De Bruyne is the obvious replacement for Yaya, and B Silva for David Silva for example.  And of course Haaland could be the long awaited replacement for Agüero"
"Yaya is one of the most talented players I’ve ever seen.  At his peak, he was nearly unbeatable"
"I remember being so confident with our free kicks back then. He was so consistent. And those runs, goals 11 and 20 against Cardiff and Villa, where he'd run in a straight line for 40 yards and no one could do anything about it. That's peak Touré."
"I think some have forgotten just how good he was.

Side note eleven Yayas would have been pretty great"
"He was unplayable for a couple of seasons. He should've played #9, I would'vs loved to see that."
Gods he was STRONG then
has there been a time in PL history where a player felt like more of a lock to score every free kick he took than Yaya at that point? He was automatic from 20-25 yards
Him and Dzeko were simply phenomenal in the latter half of 13/14. Never seen a player BOSS the midfield like Yaya in 13/14.
"Man to me he will always be in the same bracket as Kompany, Silva and Aguero regardless of all the drama !!!"
Today was Grealish’s best performance ever in our shirt
This is peps dream
He's more than earned his fried rice and Singapore chow mein
"Absolutely loved seeing the effort he put in here. Not only has his attacking ability been showing through, but the pressing and defensive intensity have been off the charts! Absolutely love this man and everything he’s been doing for the last year… keeps getting better and better"
From Jackdini to De Grealish. What a game this man played today.
Let’s hope Tuchel starts Cancelo at right back for Bayern in the Champions League and that Grealish embarrasses Cancelo as badly as he embarrassed TAA today.
"u/adfantastic6235

Why are you not commenting this afternoon?

Honestly feels like the Grealish haters would rather see us lose than have Grealish winning games.

""it's weird that grealish gets more backing than mahrez who has done a lot more.""

""am i tweaking or pep can't see that mahrez and grealish both on the wing does nothing for us....""

""i don't understand what pep sees in jack that he needs to keep foden on the bench for him, even cole palmer who is a little to selfish looks better on the left""

""grealish keeping possession with a thousand back passes""

""grealish as cam? he hardly creates as much foden or gundo could from that position""

""frustrating watching mahrez and grealish give rodri the ball a million times""

""enlighten me? acting like grealish is a good and can't be easily replaced or bench we would still create enough damage""

""watching football since 2010, what is possible there that i wouldn't know? next you're gonna tell me jack grealish is worth 100m?""

""simply said he's being overrated for doing things that are ordinary, you're behaving as if grealish is doing some life changing things for our team""

u/exciseduty

Where are you?

""27 year old and 100m£ and nothing to show for it. Btw what excuses are being made for him now? Earlier it was he will come good in second season, which he hasn't in short time he hasn't. Blue moon is happy he is winning corners they are making excuses of not having proper nLB. Pogba level excuses here""

""Still here he is still average and will be average. One game against an average opponent means  nothing. £100m have been wasted"""
"The one-timer by KDB to gain the advantage and send Mahrez on his way. Sublime. 
Brilliant team goal."
"Over and over again. I said just wait, let him adjust. Let him figure it out. 


Jack Grealish has arrived for this team and he's surpassed what I even thought we were getting. Him being this good defensively was something I never saw coming.

What I love where he chases down Salah is that he's already gone before the pass is made. He's seen where the danger is and he's given himself the headstart for it."
Lmaoooooo shithousery
Watch r/soccer have a heart attack over this
Handshake with Arthur never change pep
"It looks like Tsimikas said something to Pep at the start of the clip. but his mouth is covered so we cant see it. 

But honestly I would love it if Pep keeps getting unhinged as we win games "
Super pep 
"People at /r/sOcCeR are so salty at this lmao, I fucking love this bald bastard"
LMAO RIDICULOUS
THAT'S MY MANAGER

You can do it Rory!! We all believe in you!
People won't like to admit it but this is the real reason Pep subbed Haaland off so early.
AND I CAN’T WAIT
![gif](giphy|noykqNTEMZ3VPyDybv)
Just pull a pep -> overthink and ignore haaland goals all-together. Put timo yellow card instead or something.
"

I know your creative & clever talents are up for it!"
This one will be special
I actually love when we win with a dodgy ref decision. Makes the tears from other fans sweeter
We'll be waiting for your cartoon art :D
"Sometimes I wish we just have a normal keeper, that ball was going to the sideline but no Ederson had to bum rush out of his box."
I love him
He’s beautiful
1 point but a happy point. Nice day….more please! Seeing this what we call a happy ending.
"I hope he gives us a couple more seasons at least, but he'll be off eventually and its killing me already."
It really does feel like he likes the club alot
Me when I see Koulibaly getting sent the shop
He’s never going to leave us.
"He's talking about relegation, he loves relegation"
"If you love that, you’ll love being relegated"
"If you love that, you’ll love being relegated"
All I have to say is ELLIS. FUCKING. SIMMS.
Putting the Tottenham match into the “We could pick up some points” category is looking more realistic to me.
I’ve just bought my 3 year old daughter this kit… she’s doing a ballet recital tomorrow - very tempted to just stick the pink kit on her instead of her ballerina clobber 
"11 points in 10 games for the target.  To be fair I’d prefer a target of 21 because of so many teams clumped together.

But let’s look on the bright side.  We have Ellis SIMMS!!!"
There it is
I like this version best! UTFT
ITS DYCHE SEASON
Absolute KING
"Unreal to wake up to this morning, I knew we could get something from this game. UTFT."
"Are you worried about relegation? I’m not. I really think Dyche can get us the points we need. If we started the season with him, we wouldn’t be in relegation at all."
***My captain.***
"Fucking pussy. Kicks gray on the ground then goes into a full fledged performance. Especially glad they didn’t get the 3

And for the record I’m not saying Douc was in the right. But the point stands"
"This, and watching Kane go to him after the game and plead his case. Coleman has proper clout in this league."
Englands captain vs Irelands captain in a mental battle.
"“How does my undercarriage smell, Kane?”"
All the people saying any premier League player would do the same thing clearly weren't watching after Keane got up almost immediately after THAT challenge.
"Kane really didn't need to hit the ground like a sniper victim, we have VAR and it would have been looked at and Doucs would have rightly got his red. The only difference is that Kane would have retained some dignity...."
"I met Seamus last summer when he was playing in the States. Dude was a class act. I can’t begin to explain how kind but also focused on the match against an MLS opponent he was. 


I’m about 6 months younger than Seamus and I hope to be like him when I grow up.


Edit: Any respect I had for Harry Kane was lost today while I watched the game in my office. What a frickin pansy. Go miss another PK when it matters most ya fricking child."
Doucoure was at fault but man I wouldn't have upset if he'd just taken a chunk out of Kane's leg instead of slapping his face
"When you open up the webster dictionary to bitch, it's just a picture of Harry Kane"
I just watched the Jagielka goal earlier too shades of that
Put him up front
Holy shit. What a banger!!!
Don't give keano that kind of space. Obviously
"At work on a train and I just laid on the horn after that hit 

UTFT!!!!"
Fucking hell what a mad bastard
Bolt from the Everton blue
WHAT A FUCKING PISS MISSILE. SHADES OF ANDROS TOWNSEND.
He teased a banger with the chest and volley in the first half
Keane is the kind of guy who will put us in the relegation zone and then save us from it
I honestly didn’t know he was still playing at 40. Congratulations to him.
Respect to Jags! A wonderful Everton captain and Everton centre back when we needed his leadership.
Legend!
What a great player he was for us.
"Imagine a prime Jags - Tarky partnership 

Although jags and distan we’re quality"
Captain fantastic!
"My all time favourite player! Congratulations jags mate what an achievement.

Love ya bro!"
 met his sister on holiday

Missed these so much. Bonus Krafth in the mix and Gordon’s first photo. Absolute joy.
Where's Karius? Is he safe? Is he alright?
Just noticed how absolutely ripped Murphy is. Absolute unit
Tfw you don’t get sent off for a second time in a row at home
"Hell of a header from Isak like, like hell of a header!"
"Been too long since we saw these pics, great to see it back today"
"I’m worried Miggy is going to fail a drugs test, those eyes."
Mike Tindall managing to look pinging on every single photo he’s in
Been a while since this; much overdue. Good result.
Yeo. There it is.
It’s unreal to think that we’ve lost the same number of games as first place arsenal at the minute.
I want every fan in the changing room victory shot when we win the league.
Who are the two lads infront of and behind the two goal scorers??
"I want to know how the new owners feel, this season has been unreal. They must be surprised at the least right? Or if anything they must feel like buying this club was the right decision."

Pope has had a shocker there like. Looks like he's already hit up Bigg Market
Who are the guys to the left of Willock crouching and above Willock.
I have been dreaming of CL for too long.  To be able to drink it with Spurs tears would be heavenly.
"What a signing. A martial arts kick finish, a legendary assist (minus VAR bullshit) and one of the coolest penalties I’ve ever seen"
Made a keeper like Navas look like a pole stuck to the ground.
Put up the statue
This lad is going to be a legend here. What a player he is!
"Get in lad. I swear watching Newcastle will be the death of me, my heart was going like the clappers."
Gimme gimme gimme a striker from Sweden
"The love he has for the fans as well, I don’t know if he was the same for Sociedad, but it seems like whenever he has the chance to pump up the atmosphere he uses it"
People gave us shit for paying 60m for him but he looks absolutely fucking immense. Absolute bargain if you ask me.
"What a baller, that skill and cross for Anderson’s goal was sublime as well"
"Isak played it down quite a lot in the interview, said Navas knew straight away and came for him. Eddie said he had no idea what was going on. 

Love our team"
"This is the face of the man who tricked me, you, Nottingham Forest and the entire Newcastle fanbase. 

What a man, he got me. I was so convinced he was taking it."
Might be one of my favourite images of all time
"This is from just before the penalty, isn't it?

&#x200B;

That look says, ""you know what's coming, and you know there's not a thing you can do to stop it."""
"Fucking amazing. He had me fooled, that’s for sure. That shit eating grin says it all."
When you proudly drop a massive fart and nobody knows it was you
I genuinely thought this little fucker was gonna take it and I was shitting my pants lmao.
"Great shithousery but also the sign of a crafty, streetwise captain who protects his team at all costs. He really cares."
Anyone got a clip of the shithousing?
I will NEVER tire of these photos.  EVER.
Karius has some beautiful hair like
"Good to see Kraft in there too, out all season and travelling to our away matches"
Anderson and Murphy having a flex off! 
"Anderson and Murphy ripped, Karius long flowing locks. Newcastle Greek Gods FC confirmed"
Isak has a real look of divilment in these photos and I love it
"Nice to see Gordon there despite injury, and Karius & Krafth loving it too."
Karius looks even more handsome with his hair down
Bloody hell Anderson is a beast
